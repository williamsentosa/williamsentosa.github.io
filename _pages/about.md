About me
======

I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), advised by [Prof. Brighten Godfrey](https://pbg.cs.illinois.edu). Before joining UIUC, I worked with [Prof. Shan Lu](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~shanlu/) and [Prof. Henry Hoffmann](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~hankhoffmann/) from UChicago to build an auto-configuration framework for systems software. I earned a BS degree in Computer Science from Bandung Institute of Technology, Indonesia, in 2017.  

My research interests span broadly in the area of **networked systems**, including (but not limited to) low-latency networking, cellular networks, wide-area networks, ML Sys, Sys for ML, and VR/AR systems.

<span style="color:red">**Note:** I am on the job market for 2025, looking for a research lab or research engineering position.</span>

I enjoy building systems, and these are three topics that I have been working on:
- Low latency networking
	- [DChannel](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi23-sentosa.pdf) provides a network-layer multipath solution that utilizes network slices in 5G (eMBB and URLLC) to achieve low latency and high bandwidth (**NSDI'23**, **HotMobile'21**) 
	- [HVC](https://pbg.cs.illinois.edu/papers/touseef23hvc.pdf) explores the challenges and opportunities of using emerging differentiated services across multiple networking layers. (**HotNets'23**)
	- [WTSN](files/wtsn-hotmobile25.pdf) achieves low latency in WiFi by using TSN through a multipath design (**HotMobile'25**)
	- [cISP](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi22-paper-bhattacherjee.pdf) proposes a design of wide-area networks that move data at near light speed in a vacuum (**NSDI'22**)
- Network emulation for network protocol evaluation
	- [CellReplay](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi25-sentosa.pdf) is an accurate record-and-replay emulator for cellular networks (**NSDI'25** üèÜ) 
- Offloading VR/AR components to the cloud
	- [RemoteVIO](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3712676.3714442) offloads head tracking to a remote server (**MMSys'25**)
	- [OpenWarp](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3712676.3714444) improves the cloud rendering experience through a mesh-based reprojection technique  (**MMSys'25**)
